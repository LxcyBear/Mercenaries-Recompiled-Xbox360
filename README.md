## The mission

Build a **native Xbox 360** edition of *Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction* by
using the already-translated original Xbox **x86-to-C game code**, recompiling
that code for Xbox 360 **PowerPC**, and **porting/replacing the surrounding PC
compatibility runtime** with native Xbox 360 implementations.

Our starting point is [Mercenaries-Recompiled](https://github.com/KraftMacAndChee/Mercenaries-Recompiled)
by KraftMacAndChee, which uses [xboxrecomp](https://github.com/sp00nznet/xboxrecomp).
The upstream project statically recompiles a specific original Xbox retail
executable and runs it on Windows x64. Its gameplay and script logic comes from
the translated game. Its current rendering, audio, input, memory mapping and
kernel support are Windows-hosted compatibility layers.

**Chosen route: hybrid native port + static recompilation.** We do *not* plan to
reconstruct the entire game engine from scratch, retranslate its machine code
unnecessarily, or simply repackage the Windows executable. We do need to adapt
the translator output and build a real Xbox 360-native host.

This is not the original Xbox backward-compatibility emulator and not an
emulator running inside an XEX. `default.xex` is the intended native output.

### Scope and distribution rules

- Supported original Xbox game input must come from the user's own legal retail
  copy. The upstream project identifies the supported USA retail XBE with
  SHA-256 `AA08EA21D952AC35F49C02C7E2ED08AA25AD7535FBBBCCC95636775F37BE99D7`.
- Do not commit or distribute a game ISO, extracted game files, the retail XBE,
  copyrighted generated game code, XDK headers/libraries, or Microsoft SDK assets.
- Preserve upstream attribution and the applicable **per-file licenses**; the
  root MIT license does not supersede LGPL and third-party components.
- A successful `default.xex` build is **not** evidence of gameplay. Real-hardware
  startup, graphics, input and asset loading must be verified separately.

## Live project status

Progress is based on **tested exit criteria**, not invented percentage values.
Each phase has independently checkable checkpoints below.

| Phase | State | Exit criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **0 — Foundation and audit** | **In progress** | Portable memory tests PASS and guest memory access/lvalue audit documented |
| **1 — Native XDK bootstrap** | **In progress — hardware launch/input/clean exit verified** | Diagnostic XEX builds, runs on a real 360, logs heartbeats and exits cleanly |
| 2 — Guest memory + retail XBE loading | Not started | Correct Xbox guest bytes/addresses, section loading, aliases, MMIO fixture PASS |
| 3 — PPC recompilation + x86 guest ABI | Not started | Real-console instruction/call/stack/FP fixtures agree with reference |
| 4 — Native platform + kernel services | Not started | Required file, input, thread, timing, handle and guest callback fixtures PASS |
| 5 — Xenos graphics + first frame | Not started | Verified first frame, then main menu, then 3D rendering |
| 6 — Audio, movies and streaming | Not started | Audio/video/streaming timing and resource tests PASS |
| 7 — Gameplay, stability and release | Not started | Repeated playable scenarios, save/load, mission progression and documented release |

**Already written in Draft PR #1:** portable little-endian guest-memory
helpers, a host-side test source, a platform architecture note, and an initial
15-second **diagnostic-only** XDK entry point. The portable guest-memory tests
**pass GCC 14.2.0, Clang 17.0.0 and Clang UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer** on a
Linux x86-64 host, with exact Git blob SHA checks. **No Xbox 360 XEX build or
hardware test has been performed.**

**Present blockers:** no verified Xbox 360 executable; original Xbox guest data
is little-endian while Xbox 360 PowerPC is big-endian; generated `MEM16/32/64`
expressions are assignable native-pointer lvalues; Windows x64 guest-memory
aperture and mapped aliases are unavailable as-is; D3D11, Win32, DXGI, and
host audio dependencies need native replacements.

### Immediate next tests

1. **Done:** run portable endian tests on a PC (GCC, Clang and UBSan; see
   evidence below).
2. Build the small XDK diagnostic from the active development branch as an
   Xbox 360 **game/XEX** target using the user's installed XDK and VS17.
3. Launch it from an isolated test folder on RGH/JTAG Xbox 360 hardware,
   **never replacing a dashboard or boot XEX**. Verify heartbeat and log path.
4. Confirm controller A exits, then confirm the 15-second timeout in a separate
   run. Capture any debugger/xbWatson output.
5. Feed real results back into this README, including failed tests, before
   beginning guest-memory integration.

### Evidence policy

`[x]` = source/analysis task confirmed as **done**; it does **not** indicate
hardware validation unless the item explicitly says so. `[ ]` = outstanding.
Milestones move to **Done** only with test evidence. When a new change lands,
update the **status table, affected checklist, blockers, evidence table, and
progress log in the same commit/PR**, so the README stays synchronized with
actual progress. Failed experiments belong in the log, too.

## Detailed roadmap

### Phase 0 — Audit, test harness, and portable memory foundation

**Purpose:** retain the working upstream PC path and establish a testable
guest-memory contract before modifying generated code.

- [x] Confirm static original Xbox x86-to-C translation is reusable.
- [x] Identify the direct `MEM8/16/32/64` macros, shared register globals, and
      `g_xbox_mem_offset` guest-to-host address mapping.
- [x] Write explicit little-endian 16/32/64-bit and float access helpers in
      the development branch (not integrated with generated code yet).
- [x] Write unaligned byte-order tests in the development branch (not yet run).
- [x] Run the portable endian tests with GCC 14.2.0 and Clang 17.0.0 on Linux
      x86-64; also run Clang UBSan. All 3 passed. Confirm that the tested
      source Git blobs match the branch versions (guest endian header
      `289c8792` and test source `00149528`). This is **not** PowerPC proof.
- [ ] Audit read, write, compound assignment and read-modify-write forms in
      generated C, maintained lifter, patches, manual hooks, guest structures
      and hardware MMIO.
- [ ] Record baseline memory/instruction results from the current Windows port
      to compare against future PowerPC output.
- [ ] Inventory source/toolchain dependencies and choose a clean platform
      boundary so upstream Windows builds continue to work.

**Gate 0:** proven portable tests and an explicit plan for removing the
incorrect native-endian guest pointer dereferences without losing lvalue
semantics.

### Phase 1 — Xbox 360 toolchain and safe hardware bootstrap

**Purpose:** establish a reproducible XDK build/launch/logging loop *before*
trying to run original Xbox guest game code.

- [x] Add source for a **diagnostic-only** console entry point to Draft PR #1.
- [x] Open or reuse a VS17 Xbox 360 XDK **game** project using the user's working SDK; **build succeeded on October 18, 2026**.
      link only required system libraries and include the bootstrap source.
- [ ] Confirm the produced Xbox 360 XEX filename/path and record the VS17/XDK build output. **Compilation succeeded; deployment artifact path has not yet been recorded here.**
- [x] Launch from a new isolated folder; real RGH/JTAG hardware execution confirmed October 18, 2026.
- [x] Confirm debug output: xbWatson captured `[Merc360]` startup, heartbeat, controller and shutdown messages.
- [x] Confirm 1-second heartbeats and controller 0 detection on real hardware.
- [x] Confirm A-button exit and clean XAPI return value 0.
- [ ] Confirm the independent 15-second automatic timeout in a separate run.
- [ ] Record console model, kernel, build flavor, XEX size, debugger/xbWatson
      transcript and any failed test cases.
- [ ] Add a small probe for CPU endian, available memory, file access,
      high-resolution timing and allocation failures.

**Gate 1:** real RGH/JTAG hardware produces consistent startup, log, input
and shutdown evidence. A black screen from this diagnostic is expected;
**it has no renderer**.

### Phase 2 — Original Xbox guest memory / XBE sections

**Purpose:** safely reproduce original Xbox 32-bit guest addresses in
Xbox 360 native memory.

- [ ] Allocate/measure a bounded guest RAM arena, starting with the original
      title's normal 64 MiB guest RAM requirement where feasible.
- [ ] Implement checked guest VA routing: RAM, mirrors, aliases, synthetic
      kernel area and GPU/APU MMIO regions.
- [ ] Implement endian-correct, alignment-safe guest 8/16/32/64-bit reads
      and writes, including floating-point bit representations.
- [ ] Replace direct native pointer semantics with explicit checked access;
      reject unsupported regions instead of corrupting unrelated memory.
- [ ] Load a verified retail XBE: validate hash/header, copy sections,
      zero-fill virtual tails, initialize stack/heap and section protections
      where applicable.
- [ ] Compare original-Xbox guest memory fixtures and address alias behavior.
- [ ] Stress-test fragmentation, out-of-range pointers and low-memory paths.

**Gate 2:** exact guest byte/alias/section fixtures PASS on a real Xbox 360.

### Phase 3 — PowerPC-safe generated C and execution ABI

**Purpose:** preserve guest x86 instruction behavior even though host code
executes as Xbox 360 PowerPC.

- [ ] Audit translated instruction helpers for x86-only intrinsics,
      compiler extensions, native-endian casts, 32/64-bit assumptions and
      Windows/MSVC-specific code.
- [ ] Update **maintained translator / lifter / patch generator**, not
      disposable `ports/mercenaries/src/recomp/gen` files, for explicit
      endian-safe guest reads/writes/RMW.
- [ ] Generate and compile isolated instruction fixtures under the actual
      Xbox 360 compiler before attempting all translated functions.
- [ ] Validate flags, sign extension, stack/calling convention, frame saving,
      `RECOMP_ICALL` dispatch, direct/tail calls and function returns.
- [ ] Validate x87, MMX and SSE semantics against the original instruction
      results; test rounding, NaN and exceptional paths.
- [ ] Evaluate Xenon limitations: native stack depth, object/code size,
      memory budget and compiler/linker constraints.
- [ ] Execute a bounded translated function, then a small call chain, then
      the game's entry sequence with guardrails and logging.

**Gate 3:** reproducible real-hardware guest ABI fixture suite PASS with
reference comparisons.

### Phase 4 — Xbox 360 platform and original Xbox kernel bridge

**Purpose:** provide original Xbox guest services using native Xbox 360 APIs.

- [ ] Inventory original Xbox kernel imports *actually used by Mercenaries*
      and keep the subset explicit.
- [ ] Replace Win32 memory, file I/O, event/handle, thread and
      synchronization implementations without losing guest ordering.
- [ ] Implement title-owned path mapping for games, saves and logs.
- [ ] Support Xbox 360 controller input and original-game button mapping.
- [ ] Preserve guest timers, callbacks, interrupts, DPC/ISR safe points and
      thread scheduling expectations.
- [ ] Validate guest kernel data exports and safe callback delivery.
- [ ] Exercise real asset reads and title shutdown/error cases.

**Gate 4:** startup service requests and title-critical imports have verified
native implementations, not unexplained stubs.

### Phase 5 — Native Xbox 360 graphics (Xenos)

**Purpose:** replace NV2A/PGRAPH-to-D3D11 hosting with a correct native
360 graphics backend.

- [ ] Inventory actual Mercenaries NV2A pushbuffers, texture formats,
      swizzle, render states, vertex programs, combiners and surface aliases.
- [ ] Introduce backend-neutral presentation/texture/draw interfaces.
- [ ] Initialize an Xbox 360 graphics device and render an independent test
      surface (not yet the game).
- [ ] Implement compatible 2D, textured draw and flip operations.
- [ ] Translate needed shaders and vertex formats; validate depth/stencil,
      blending, alpha testing, render targets and synchronization.
- [ ] Capture the first guest-rendered frame; then the main menu;
      then a reproducible 3D scene, comparing to the working PC reference.
- [ ] Measure frame time, GPU memory and render errors on hardware.

**Gate 5:** repeatable first frame and functional title/menu/scene graphics.

### Phase 6 — Audio, movies, asset streaming and timing

- [ ] Identify needed original Xbox APU, DirectSound and XACT behavior.
- [ ] Implement/bridge native Xbox 360 audio output, sound decoding and
      channel/mixing behavior.
- [ ] Preserve sample progression, callbacks and cutscene timing.
- [ ] Implement required movie playback or a lawful user-side conversion
      approach without bundling proprietary video.
- [ ] Validate loading/streaming on console storage within available RAM.
- [ ] Test music, dialogue, SFX, movie transitions and long idle playback.

**Gate 6:** no critical missing sound, timing drift or cutscene softlock in
the documented test scenarios.

### Phase 7 — Gameplay, reliability and packaging

- [ ] Start game, use menus, load world and control a character.
- [ ] Test driving, combat, AI, mission triggers and asset loading.
- [ ] Test save/load, checkpoints and repeated cold starts.
- [ ] Run extended sessions and record memory/CPU/GPU use and crashes.
- [ ] Optimize only after profiling actual hardware; document FPS and
      resolution measurements rather than speculative targets.
- [ ] Produce repeatable builds, provenance, bug list and setup guide.
- [ ] Verify no proprietary Xbox 360 SDK or original game files are
      included in public release artifacts.

**Gate 7:** independently repeatable playable scenarios and a documented
build/install process.

## Dated development log

### 2026-10-18 — Kickoff / route selected

- Chose **native PowerPC recompilation of existing C translation + an Xbox
  360-native platform runtime** rather than reimplementing gameplay or
  attempting a Windows executable conversion.
- Audited upstream architecture, CMake targets, native memory model,
  `recomp_types.h` and the translated-code interfaces.
- Opened [Draft PR #1](https://github.com/LxcyBear/Mercenaries-Recompiled-Xbox360/pull/1)
  to isolate portable guest endian helpers, tests, and Xbox 360 target notes.
- Added source for a minimal **non-game** XDK diagnostic with 15-second safety
  exit, heartbeat, A-button input and logging fallback.
- Ran the portable byte-order and unaligned-access test successfully under
  GCC 14.2, Clang 17, and Clang UBSan; confirmed exact Git blob identities.
- Corrected a test diagnostic newline and added
  [VS17/XDK XEX build instructions](https://github.com/LxcyBear/Mercenaries-Recompiled-Xbox360/blob/xbox360/bootstrap-guest-memory/ports/mercenaries/xbox360/bootstrap_xex/BUILD_FIRST_XEX.md).
- Replaced the nearly empty fork README with the **phase gates, checklists,
  blockers, test evidence and durable progression log**.
- **Next gate:** run the same diagnostic once without pressing A to prove the 15-second safety timeout, then close Phase 1 and begin guest-memory integration.
- **No playable XEX exists.** Phase 1 hardware success is not yet claimed.

- **Build environment decision:** use the user's existing **VS17 + Xbox 360 XDK**
  configuration instead of older Visual Studio setup. Updated the Phase 1
  build guide; no actual Xbox 360 compile or console test is claimed.

### 2026-10-18 — First Xbox 360 hardware execution succeeds

- The Phase 1 diagnostic **built successfully** in the user's working
  **VS17 + Xbox 360 XDK** environment and launched on the real console.
- xbWatson captured the complete diagnostic lifecycle: bootstrap start,
  repeated one-second heartbeats, controller 0 detection, A-button detection,
  clean diagnostic shutdown and **`[XAPI RETURN VALUE] 0`**.
- codxe printed an "unknown executable Title ID" message for the test title;
  this did **not** prevent the diagnostic from running or exiting cleanly.
- **Not yet proven:** unattended 15-second timeout, guest memory, original-Xbox
  XBE loading, graphics/audio, or Mercenaries game code.
- **Next:** run once without pressing A. If the 15-second timeout exits cleanly,
  Phase 1's hardware gate is complete and Phase 2 guest-memory work begins.

### How future updates are recorded

Every substantive development change should update this README's **live table,
checklist, evidence and dated log** in the same pull request/commit. A brief
chat recap should match what is committed. If a test fails, log the failure,
do not silently reset a checklist. Preserve reproducible logs and keep branch
work isolated until the milestone is reviewable.
